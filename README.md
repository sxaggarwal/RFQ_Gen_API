README for RFQ Generation Project
RFQ Generation Project-

Project Overview:
The RFQ Generation Project is an automation software designed to streamline the process of creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) in aerospace manufacturing. This tool automates the transfer of manufacturing specifications from user-uploaded Excel sheets into the MIE Trak database and organizes related documents on the server, enhancing operational efficiency.

Features-
Automated Data Transfer: Upload Excel sheets with manufacturing specs, which are then automatically parsed and transferred to the MIE Trak database.
Document Management: Automatically organizes PDFs and drawings into designated server folders, eliminating manual file handling.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload required files and details.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python, SQL
Tools and Libraries: Tkinter, Pandas, Openpyxl, MIE Trak API

Future Improvements-
Automated Excel Filling: Implement a feature to scan and extract data from uploaded drawings and part lists to fill in the Excel sheet automatically.
Enhanced Data Validation: Add more robust validation checks to ensure data accuracy before transferring to the database.
